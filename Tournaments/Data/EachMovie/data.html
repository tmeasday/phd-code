<A NAME="what"></A>
<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P> The <A HREF="http://www.digital.com/">DEC</A>
    <A HREF="http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/"> 
       Systems Research Center</A>
    ran the EachMovie recommendation service for 18 months to
    experiment with a collaborative filtering algorithm.  During that
    time, some 72916 users entered a total of 2811983 numeric ratings
    for 1628 different movies (films and videos).  We are making this
    preference data set available, with all user identification
    removed, so that other collaborative filtering researchers can use
    it to test their algorithms.

<A NAME="schema"></A>
<H2>Schema</H2>

<P> The data set is available as eachmoviedata.tar.gz (zipped
    tab-separated-value text files, 17632000 bytes compressed).  There
    are three tables, one per file:

<UL>

<LI> Person (person.txt) provides optional, unaudited demographic data
     supplied by each person:

     <UL>
     <LI> ID: Number -- primary key
     <LI> Age: Number
     <LI> Gender: Text -- one of "M", "F"
     <LI> Zip_Code: Text
     </UL>
<P>
<LI> Movie (movie.txt) provides descriptive information about each movie:

     <UL>
     <LI> ID: Number -- primary key
     <LI> Name: Text
     <LI> PR_URL: Text -- URL of studio PR site
     <LI> IMDb_URL: Text -- URL of Internet Movie Database entry
     <LI> Theater_Status: Text -- either "old" or "current"
     <LI> Theater_Release: Date/Time
     <LI> Video_Status: Text -- either "old" or "current"
     <LI> Video_Release: Date/Time
     <LI> Action, Animation, Art_Foreign, Classic, Comedy, Drama, Family,
          Horror, Romance, Thriller: Yes/No
     </UL>

     <P> IMDb URLs are provided by courtesy of
         <A HREF="http://www.imdb.com/">Internet Movie Database</A>.

     <P> The theater and video status and release dates were
         (approximately) correct in the San Francisco bay area as of
         September 15, 1997, when EachMovie was terminated.

<P>
<LI> Vote (vote.txt) is the actual rating data:

     <UL>
     <LI> Person_ID: Number
     <LI> Movie_ID: Number
     <LI> Score: Number -- 0 &lt;= Score &lt;= 1
     <LI> Weight: Number -- 0 &lt; Weight &lt;= 1
     <LI> Modified: Date/Time
     </UL>

     <P> The Score corresponds maps linearly to the zero-to-five star
         rating used externally on EachMovie.
     
     Here's a histogram of the Score values:

     <PRE>
     Score   Count
     0	     347191
     0.2     150495
     0.4     339718
     0.6     701236
     0.8     761676
     1.0     511667
     </PRE>

     <P> Weight indicates whether the person rated a movie as zero to
         five stars (weight = 1) or "sounds awful" (weight &lt; 1).
         (Most "sounds awful" weights are 0.2, but for historical
         reasons about 10% are 0.5.)

     <P> Given our site design, there is no way to know whether the
         person had seen the movie in a theater or on video.
