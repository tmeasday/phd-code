function y = PAST_single (Advice, Tree)

%% PAST - Pick a Spanning Tree. 
%
% This function does a single run of PAST. So we've already 'picked' the
% spanning tree---now we need to grab the clustering. Well this is quite
% easy really--just give a label to 1 and then walk the tree, assigning
% labels as we go.

% makes my life easier
Advice = Advice + Advice';
Tree = Tree + Tree';

y(1) = 1;
to_search = [1];
searched  = [];

while ~isempty (to_search)
   i = to_search(end);
   
   if and
   
   new_i = Tree(i,:) == 1;
   
   y(new_i) = Advice(new_i) * y(i);
   
   
   to_search = [find(new_i), to_search(1:end-1)];
end
